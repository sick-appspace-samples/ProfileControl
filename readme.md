## ProfileControl

Finding min and max point in heightmap and calculating angle using Profile API

### Description

This Sample shows how to extract points from a heightmap transform information
to a profile. On that profile the min and max values are detected and the
angle is calculated.

### How to Run

This sample may currently be outdated.
Editing the UI might not work properly in the latest version of SICK AppStudio. Use SICK AppStudio version <= 2.4.2 to edit the UI.

Starting this sample is possible either by running the App (F5) or
debugging (F7+F10). Setting breakpoint on the first row inside the 'main'
function allows debugging step-by-step after 'Engine.OnStarted' event.
Results can be seen in the image as well as the point cloud viewer on the DevicePage.
Restarting the Sample may be necessary to show the visualization after loading the webpage.
To run this Sample a device with SICK Algorithm API and AppEngine >= V2.5.0 is
required. For example SIM4000 with latest firmware. Alternatively the Emulator
on AppStudio 2.3 or higher can be used.
